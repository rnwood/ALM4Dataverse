implementation for Dataverse to be used with Azure DevOps.

## How it compares to other options

| **Initial setup - setting up a single solution**                                      | Easy - point and click                                                                                                       | Moderate - several manual steps to follow. (However most examples leave you with a very incomplete setup)                                                                                                                                         | Easy/moderate - scripted guided setup                                                                                                                   |
| **Adding config/system data**                                                         | Requires Power Automate Flow creation which isn't well suited to this task.                                                  | Can be added with the Configuration Migration Tool PPBT tasks, but these are fatally flawed and very limited. [Read why here.](https://rnwood.co.uk/posts/versioning-config-data-in-power-platform-beyond-the-cmt/)                                | Easy - edit 2 files. [Read about the approach used here.](https://rnwood.co.uk/posts/versioning-config-data-in-power-platform-beyond-the-cmt/\)          |
| **Ensuring correct (and optimum) solution install, upgrade or update method is used** | Automatically does install or upgrade, but doesn't ever consider 'update' when it's possible (leaves some perf on the table) | The default PPBT tasks don't hande this. Can be achieved, but is quite complex (and most examples don't cover it). [Read more about this here](https://rnwood.co.uk/posts/azdo-dataverse-solution-deployment-solution-upgrade-vs-solution-import/) | Built-in logic for install vs upgrade (first time install vs upgrade) and upgrade vs update (when it's safe to do so because changes are additive only) |
