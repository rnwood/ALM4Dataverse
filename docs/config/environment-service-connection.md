# Service Connection Configuration

This document describes the service connections that should be configured in Azure DevOps for each environment to support the ALM4Dataverse pipelines.

## Overview

Service connections in Azure DevOps authenticate the pipelines to your Dataverse environments. ALM4Dataverse uses Power Platform service connections to connect to each environment during export and deployment operations.

For detailed steps on creating service principals and service connections, see the [Manual Setup Guide](../setup/manual-setup.md#4-service-principal-setup).

## Service Connection Type

### Power Platform Service Connection

ALM4Dataverse uses Power Platform service connections to authenticate to Dataverse environments.

**Type**: Power Platform (with Application Id and client secret)

**Configuration**:
- **Authentication Type**: Application Id and client secret
- **Server URL**: Your Dataverse environment URL (e.g., `https://yourorg.crm.dynamics.com`)
- **Tenant ID**: The Directory (tenant) ID from your App Registration in Entra ID
- **Application ID**: The Application (client) ID from your App Registration
- **Client Secret**: The client secret value from your App Registration

## Service Connection Naming Convention

Service connections follow the naming pattern used in the pipelines:

`{EnvironmentName}`

**Examples**:
- `DEV-main` - for the Dev environment on main branch
- `PROD` - for the PROD environment

## Setting Up Service Connections

See [Service Principal Setup](../setup/manual-setup.md#4-service-principal-setup) in the Manual Setup Guide for detailed instructions on:

1. Creating an App Registration in Entra ID
2. Creating a client secret
3. Creating an application user in each Dataverse environment
4. Creating the service connection in Azure DevOps

## Example Service Connection Configuration

### Development Environment (Dev-main)

| Connection Name | Environment URL | Authentication |
|---|---|---|
| `Dev-main` | `https://yourorg-dev.crm.dynamics.com` | Service Principal: `YourProject - Dev - deployment` |

### Test Environment (TEST-main)

| Connection Name | Environment URL | Authentication |
|---|---|---|
| `TEST-main` | `https://yourorg-test.crm.dynamics.com` | Service Principal: `YourProject - TEST - deployment` |

### Production Environment (PROD)

| Connection Name | Environment URL | Authentication |
|---|---|---|
| `PROD` | `https://yourorg.crm.dynamics.com` | Service Principal: `YourProject - PROD - deployment` |

## Best Practices

### Security

- **System Administrator Role**: Assign the System Administrator security role to the application user in each Dataverse environment to allow solution import and export
- **Dedicated Service Principals**: Create separate service principals for each environment (e.g., separate app registrations for Dev, TEST, UAT, and PROD)
- **Client Secret Rotation**: Rotate client secrets periodically and track expiration dates to prevent authentication failures
